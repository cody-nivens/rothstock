# rothstock
This project is a two fold creature.  First is the Rails project and second is the setup to distribute a container for either Docker or Kubernetes.

RothStock started as an attempt to determine stocks for my Roth account years ago (read when I had money :)).

The idea is to 
* buy stock that pays a dividend 
* when such a dividend is paid, buy more shares of the same stock.

This process gives a two fold return on an invenstment:
* First is the rising (one hopes) price of the stock.
* The second is the increased amount of stock (original stock + shares bought by dividend).

The second part of the project is what I am working on now.

To set up the secrets for running this app, do the following.

```sh
$ bundle exec rake secret
8d428e9d27e3323f1b1ec0089482017480224c9984fc10327f95b0990ec46175d43d756fd644c3bca3703a337a94ced69c868ab0470ac201cd1b6a80c3f89e4a
```

Encode the secret key base using base64.

```sh
$ echo -n "8d428e9d27e3323f1b1ec0089482017480224c9984fc10327f95b0990ec46175d43d756fd644c3bca3703a337a94ced69c868ab0470ac201cd1b6a80c3f89e4a" | base64

```

Next, encode the database credentials. Use the format DB_ADAPTER://USER:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME/DB_NAME. If you are using mysql with a user 'deploy' and a password 'secret' on 127.0.0.1 and have a database railsapp, run

```sh
$ echo -n "mysql://deploy:secret@127.0.0.1/railsapp"|base64
