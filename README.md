# README

This project is a two fold creature.  First is the Rails project and second is the setup to distribute a container for either Docker or Kubernetes.

RothStock started as an attempt to determine stocks for my Roth account years ago (read when I had money :)).

The idea is to 
# buy stock that pays a dividend 
# when such a dividend is paid, buy more shares of the same stock.

This process gives a two fold return on an invenstment:
# First is the rising (one hopes) price of the stock.
# The second is the increased amount of stock (original stock + shares bought by dividend).

The second part of the project is what I am working on now.
